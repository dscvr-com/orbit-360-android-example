# Orbit360 Android SDK - Example

This example shows how to use the Orbit360 Android SDK from with an Android App. 

The Example App simply connects to an Orbit360 on startup, and then allows the user to move the Orbit360's arms using buttons. The user can also control the speed. An estimate of the current position of the arm is provided. 

To accomplish this, the Example App utilizes the `ScriptRunner` class. 

The single view of this Example App (`CommandView.java`) contains comments to explain the procedure.
